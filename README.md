Chatinator
==========

this is/will/might be/is/am a chat client that I intend to create, my main motivation behind it is to further my understanding of programming and to improve my skills, especially in relation to how programs can interact with the internet.

My goals are completely insame and in the course of writing this application I am probably going to have to rewrite it a few times, seeing as I'm in completely above my head.

Without further ado here is my planning so far:
===============================================


write a encrypted chat client with easy to join groups and complete privacy, lots of easter eggs and 

stuff like /shitlist and /unlurk on first posting to make yourself known. enclude liks a little 

profile, maybe just links you care about or a small summary or something.

steal heavely from crypto cat 

/ stalk username lets you follow all of someone's chats

/cloak makes you unstalkable

/uncloak makes you stalkable

the stalk feature is for creating social groups

/dual * creates a game of rock paper scisors to derermine a action to take part a user types /rock ect 

or /abst to abstain.

whoever creats a chat can either specify modded or unmodded and can assign mods.

private chat feature

/topic: politics creates a new topic within a chat, all posts in this topic are assigned a new colour 

and can be viewed seperately by typing /politics but are still displayed within the main chat to post 

in them you type //politics your message here to post normally type \your message here. 
the idea is to be able to have multiple topics in a chat at the same time. to invit someone to a chat 

type /politics username "invete message", username the invite message is not required 


make it capable of sending picters and gifs and stuff but make them hidde so that the user needs to 

click them before they load, text is supposed to be the main form of communication.
